        // Actually first we write testcases mannually then execute them in POSTMAN then on REST ASSURED.


      // Steps to check the project:-
      // API Documentation, Import the request to POSTMAN
      // iF WE DONOT HAVE DOCUMENTATION we have to create by ourselves
      // Write the test cases in the Excel.
      // Write in the postman
      // Execute in the POSTMAN.
      // Report the Bugs-
      // Submit the test report -> in the form of HTML Report.
        // Create collection means -  Bunch of Requests.
        // Import via:- 1) Mannual Method 2) Curl Method.
        // Curl is command line way to transfer the data from client to server.
        // Syntax of Curl:-
        // curl -X POST\  followed by URL- MEANS CURL with HTTP method along with X
        // -H  ""for headers and -d ""for payload
        // iF CURL IS NOT GIVEN TO US THEN inspect -> nework-> login-> copy as curl-> paste on import
        // We can write the test cases to POSTMAN in three ways :- 1) super easy way by using AI
        // 2) Easy way - Snippets :- cLICK ON ICON > AND ADD SNIPPETS.
        //3) Advance way(Medium level) in this case we should know the basics of javascript
