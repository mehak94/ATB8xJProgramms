        // Mock Server :- When APIs are not ready , mock -> faking, masking, dummy APIs.
       // So while it is being developed , we can still write the testcases, or think about the approach, test plan

        // We can create fake APIs by using POSTMAN with limited functionality and with JSON Server with more functionality
        // Watch class of 25th Nov
        // We can also create with the help of Mockoon

        // API monitoring refers to the systematic process of gathering , analyzing, and visualizing data related to
        // API performance and behaviour.
