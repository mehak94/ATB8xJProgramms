        // OOPs means object oriented language and Java is the best example of it.
        // 1) Encapsulation ( A feature that bundles data information into a single unit , hiding implementation details from users to increase data security)
        // 2) Polymorphism ( It enables the creation of a single interface to represent different types of objects)
        // 3) Abstraction ( A feature that uses simple classes to represent complexity , allowing users to see only relevant info)
        // 4) Inheritance ( A mechanism that allows  class to be derived from another classes, creating a hierarchy)
