// Abstraction is hiding the implementation.
    // In encapsulation we can hide instance variable by using methods within the class.
    // In ABSTRACTION WE HIDE THE COMPLETE CLASS( WITH DATA MEMBERS AND METHODS)
    // Abstract is keyword
    // We can achieve abstraction in two ways either by using keyword abstract or interface.
    // We can create abstraction by using keyword abstract
    // abstract can be a class or method or both
    // It means incomplete.
  // If a class doesnot have any abstract method then it is a concrete class
