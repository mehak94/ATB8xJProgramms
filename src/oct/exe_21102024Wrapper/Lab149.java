        //s1.contains()- Behaviour but we cannot do a. for this we can use wrapper class.
        // Why Java is not pure oops ? bec it has primitive datatypes.
        // We can also write like this
        Integer i = 10; // Integer is a class which can have multiple functions that we can use.
    }
}
// Wrapper classes in java are essential components that allow primitive data types to be treated as objects.
// need to convert primitive date type to convert into wrapper is that we (int to Integer) in future we are going to use Collection Framework
// in that we will use only classes and objects and which are only present in wrapper classes not in primitive data types.
