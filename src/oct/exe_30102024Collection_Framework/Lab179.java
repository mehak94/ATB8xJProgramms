        // Arraylist elements will be stored internally using indexing notation.
        // This is one of the most widely used concrete class.
// Concrete class means complete class nothing is incomplete.(fully implemented class not abstract).
        // It is fast to access the elements but insertion and deletion is slow .

        // Vectors:-
        // Everything is same but only one difference is there which is that vetor methods are synchronized,
        // so vector objects can't be accessed by multiple threads at a time.

        // Linkedlist:-
        // Linkedlist allows duplicates and internally implements a doubly_linked list data structure.
        // In it elements are stored internelly using a node representation.
        // It is fast to insert or delete the elements but slow for accessing the elements.
